# JiseokHan.github.io

This repository contains the source for **Jiseok Han's** personal site built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). It can be served locally for development or deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```
2. Start a local server:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```
   The site will be available at `http://localhost:4000` by default.

## Deployment Notes

The site is configured for deployment on GitHub Pages. After pushing changes to the `main` branch, GitHub Pages will automatically build and publish the site. If you modify `Gemfile` or `_config.yml`, ensure that any required plugins are supported by GitHub Pages.
